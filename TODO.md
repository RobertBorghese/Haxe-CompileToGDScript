# TODO

 - [x] Everything I've done so far
 - [x] Implement `@:nativeFunctionCode` in Reflaxe
 - [x] Implement smarter EIE unwrap to create less code blocks.
 - [x] Add expression optimizer to move variable declarations down that are unused before reassignment.
 - [x] Inline `trace` and implement `haxe.Log`?
 - [ ] Adding int to string doesn't convert the int?
 - [ ] Checking if custom struct has field (struct.fieldName != null) should be converted to (struct.has("fieldName"))
 - [ ] Static var support
 - [ ] Dynamic function support
 - [ ] `_std/Sys.hx`
 - [ ] Add all the other std lib stuff
 - [ ] Godot bindings (`std/godot`) (maybe bindings maker in `gdscript` package?)
